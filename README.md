## React Github Profile Viewer

React Application which consumes the GitHub API to allow users to search for specific Github profiles and displays information about the profile.

This application is the sister of [ng-Github-Profile-Searcher](https://github.com/Pierre-D-G/Ng-Github-Profile-Searcher) which also consumes the Github API.

I created it using the same API because I was more familiar with Angular  and wanted to learn  the differences between Angular and React and what better way to do that than building the same project with both.

## Getting Started

Download or clone the repository

Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependancies


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` or `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
